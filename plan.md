# Deepfake Detection Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a system that can detect deepfake images with high accuracy. The system will consist of a machine learning backend that analyzes images and a user-friendly frontend that displays the results. The detection will be based on both deep learning models and metadata analysis.
